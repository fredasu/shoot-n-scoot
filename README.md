(helpfulness is limited by version of Godot/compatability)

Player can avoid/shoot enemies, and moves due to the recoil from shooting. The edges of the screen "wrap", so a player can teleport from one side to the other (enemies can't teleport). The longer the player lasts, the higher the score.

See video for game trailer/demo.
